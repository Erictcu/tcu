# TCU

# What is TCU?
It is a privacy protocol on the eth chain, which achieves mutual privacy through zero-knowledge proof and user privacy deposits and withdrawals, and the information cannot be traced after withdrawal.
# How does it achieve privacy?
Asymmetric encryption generates deposit receipts without revealing deposit information;
Arbitrary relay withdrawals to ensure that the association between the deposit and receiving accounts is cut off;
The economic model attracts more users to participate in deposits, become relays, and promote together.
# Innovative relay,Higher security level
Users can generate relay in the APP, and perform withdraw——Low threshold
When withdrawing, the contract will select 3 relay randomly——More scientific
When the relay perform a withdraw,it also get a mining, it will motivate more users became a relay——More safe
